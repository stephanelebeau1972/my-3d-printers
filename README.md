Information about the 3D printers I use regularly<br>
<br>
Anycubic Photon:<br>
SLA printer<br>
Mostly used for tabletop gaming miniatures.<br>
<br>
Ender 3 Max:<br>
FDM printer<br>
Currently, this printer is in pieces after a couple of frustrating hardware upgrades that have gone awry.<br>
<br>
Voron 2.4R2:<br>
FDM printer<br>
Built from a Formbot kit that I purchased from 3DPrintersBay.com, this open source DIY printer is one of the more capable hobbyist 3D printers available.<br>
